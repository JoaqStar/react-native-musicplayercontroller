# react-native-musicplayercontroller

This module is being created so React-Native (and React-Native for Web) users can easily ask their users to select a song from their Library, and have some playback options, even between sessions. iOS will access their Music Library for songs/playlists that are currently on their device (not in the Cloud) using ```MPMediaPickerController```, and playback will be with ```[MPMusicPlayerController applicationMusicPlayer]``` This is the basis for the other Android and Web versions which I will try to mimic as closely as possible.


## Current State
Right now, this works decently for iOS only. Will probably be adding some more functionality as I integrate it with my own projects. Please feel free to request features, as I would like this to work for more than just myself.

Web version will be next after fully integrating the iOS version with my own current project. Web because I am so-so in web technologies.

Finally, Android will be last, and will probably take a long time since my Android experience is very, very limited. Would love help from others.

## Installation

```
npm install --save react-native-musicplayercontroller
react-native link
```

If your Xcode project has more than one Target, you will need to navigate to ```Libraries > RNReactNativeMusicplayercontroller.xcodeproj > Products > libRNReactNativeMusicplayercontroller.a``` and drag this into each ```Target's Build Phases > Link Binary with Libraries```. There should already be a few .a files in there, so it's pretty obvious. react-native link only links to the first Target.

```javascript
import MusicPlayerController from 'react-native-musicplayercontroller'
```


## Usage
 A) Users must pick a song/playlist from their device at least once before they can play audio from within your app. Without user selection, iOS apps have no access to their music library.

We'll save the memory of this track for you between app usage. It will be saved to NSUserDefaults (iOS), and thus will be erased when they delete the app. Or it will be overwritten when they choose a new track/playlist. Currently, this code only allows for one song/playlist to be saved between users picking them.

Here's how to present the Music Picker modally:
```javascript
MusicPlayerController.presentPicker((metadata)=>{
      // Successfully saved MPMediaItemCollection to NSUserDefaults.
      //    Returns an array of metadata for each track (not all MPMediaItem
      //    fields are copied, only the blantantly needed ones)
        alert(metadata[0]["title"])
    }, ()=>{
      // Opened, but user tapped Cancel
      alert("Cancel")
    })
```

B) Once the user has an actual track/playlist chosen, you can access this always, even when the user closes and reopens your app. But you need to preload the music so the player is cached. If you just call the playMusic method, and music hasn't been preloaded, it will fail.
```javascript
MusicPlayerController.preloadMusic("all", (metadata)=>{
      // Successful preload
    }, ()=>{
      // Failed to preload music. Potentially lots of reasons, such as the music file being removed from the device.
    })
```
Note that the first argument is a String. This has to do with the repeatMode. Valid values are:
```javascript
"none", // plays the song or playlist once, and doesn't repeat
"one", // plays the current song on repeat (or if it's a playlist, just the currently selected song)
"all", // plays all tracks on repeat (for a playlist, or a single track)
"default" // The userâ€™s preferred repeat mode. Currently, we always use the applicationMusicPlayer, so whatever Apple set as being the default repeat mode, that will happen. I'm not sure which one it uses though, so avoid picking this unless you know for sure what it does.
```

C) Now you can play music:
```javascript
MusicPlayerController.playMusic(()=>{
        // Successfully playing
      }, ()=>{
        // Failed to play
      })
```

D) Or pause music...
```javascript
MusicPlayerController.pauseMusic(()=>{
      // pausing music
    }, ()=> {
      // failed to pause
    })
```

E) Or stop music
```javascript
MusicPlayerController.stopMusic(()=>{
      // music stopped
    }, ()=> {
      // failed to stop music
    })
```

F) Or check if music is playing 
```javascript
MusicPlayerController.isPlaying(()=>{
      // music is playing
    }, ()=> {
      // music is not playing
    })
```


## TODO:
1. ~~Setup Test Repo and integrate with current project~~
2. ~~Write iOS Version~~ Initial Complete
3. Write Web Version
4. Hope someone writes the Android version
5. Possibly write the Android version

## My Tools
I'm not sure how to add needed dependencies, but this module currently works with React-Native 0.41, and your app needs to be able to use ES6 syntax. React-Native will load the correct .ios.js or .android.js. If you're using react-native-web, you it will load from .web.js. So make sure your packaging tool (I use webpack) is set to load .web.js files:

```javascript
// webpack.config.js

module.exports = {
    // ...
    resolve: {
        extensions: [ '.web.js', '.js' ]
    }
};
```

#### iOS
Should work for iOS 3.0+ (devices from 2009 or later). Of course React Native is requires a newer version, which may change as time goes on. But lets just say this module works for all iOS devices because it probably will.

## Common Debugging Issues

##### If you just downloaded the new version of this package...
Open your app's package.json file and make sure under dependencies, react-native-musicplayercontroller has a version number you're okay with. I like to do: ```"react-native-musicplayercontroller": "*"``` because it always prioritizes the latest version. Then:
```
npm update react-native-musicplayercontroller
```
... then you will want to restart the React-Native server. So kill that process in your terminal and restart it:
```
react-native start
```
And of course, rebuild the actual app (Xcode > Build & Run, or ```react-native run-ios```)

##### If you're testing on simulator

Unfortunately MPMediaPickerController doesn't work on the iOS Simulator. So you just get an alert if you try to open the Picker. And since you can't pick an item, playing them won't work either because you won't have anything selected.

##### Types of metadata?

I was lazy and didn't include all types of metadata... just the ones I personally want:
 ```objc
 @"artist" : item.artist,
 @"title" : item.title,
 @"albumTitle" : item.albumTitle,
 @"playbackDuration" : @(item.playbackDuration)
 ```

##### I can't do...

I know, I know. There's a lot that may be difficult to do with this module as of now. But it allows for the situation where you want a user to be able to select some music from their own library, and play is back within your own app. And that's my focus for now. Please ask any questions or ask for a feature and I'll see what I can do.
